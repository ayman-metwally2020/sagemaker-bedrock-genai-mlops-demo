# SageMaker & Bedrock – GenAI MLOps Demo

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning and GenAI workflow using Amazon SageMaker and AWS Bedrock. The focus is on building a production-ready solution that covers data preparation, training, deployment, monitoring, and GenAI-based explainability.

## Use Case
Predict telecom network performance using historical data and translate predictions into human-readable insights for operational teams.

## AWS Services Used
- Amazon SageMaker (Pipelines, Feature Store, Model Monitor, Endpoints)
- AWS Bedrock
- Amazon S3
- Amazon CloudWatch

## Project Flow
1. Data preparation and feature engineering
2. Automated ML pipeline execution
3. Model evaluation and validation
4. Deployment to a managed endpoint
5. Continuous monitoring and drift detection
6. GenAI-based explanation of predictions

## Community Value
This project is designed to help engineers and practitioners understand how to move from ML experimentation to production using AWS-native MLOps and GenAI patterns.
